\section{Lab 6}

\subsection{What?}
Ever since I began iProject 3 and looked ahead on the labs, I have been pondering this question. I am not sure if there is a moment that passes, or even a time showering where my mind has not raced with possibilities on how to answer this nearly impossible question. I toyed with the idea of inventing a time machine, and going back and asking some of the wisest minds in history their thoughts on how to put together words that fully encapsulate what you are asking of me. That may have been easier than the mental anguish I went through in order to reach a conclusion, but against all odds I have done it. Yes, I did. I know how to answer. Hours of my life and nearly all of my brain (a small portion of it had to be used to add context scheduling into my project) have led to this. The answer to your infamous question is *drumroll please*: 


python. 

WAIT NO NO I DIDNT MEA- 

\subsection{Why?}
Is probably what you're asking yourself right now. Why did he make such a cool and awesome project 3 (thank you for thinking that by the way) and then ruin it by saying the no no word. I do not have an answer for you. I really messed up on that one, and I am sorry.
